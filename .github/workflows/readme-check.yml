            Please review the README.md file and ensure it is up-to-date with the current codebase.

            Tasks:
            1. Check if action.yml inputs/outputs are correctly documented in README.md
            2. Verify all code examples in README.md are correct
            3. Check if any new features in src/ are documented
            4. Ensure configuration examples match the actual implementation

            If you find any discrepancies or improvements needed:
            - Update README.md accordingly

            If everything is up-to-date, just confirm that the README is accurate.
